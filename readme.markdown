JavaScript libraries are awesome.  jQuery, Dojo, MooTools, YUI, et al. all
have their place.  Somethimes, though, you just need one or two pieces of 
functionality on a page or project.  And that's what MinimalJS is for.

Usage
-----

Copy files into your document path, include them in your page, make use of the functions.
